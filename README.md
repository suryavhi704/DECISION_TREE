🌳 Decision Tree vs. Logistic Regression - A Comparative Study

🚀 Project Overview:-

Welcome to Decision Tree vs. Logistic Regression, a project that dives deep into the fundamentals of decision tree models and compares them with logistic regression. This project walks through the entire machine learning pipeline, from data cleaning to model evaluation, helping you understand how these two models perform on different datasets. 📉📊📈


🔥 Key Features:-

✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.✅ Building a Decision Tree Model: Understanding tree-based algorithms and constructing an optimized tree.✅ Model Selection & Depth Tuning: Finding the best tree depth for performance improvement.✅ Implementing Logistic Regression: Training a logistic regression model to compare with decision tree.✅ Comparative Analysis: Evaluating performance metrics to determine strengths and weaknesses of both models.✅ Well-structured Codebase: Easy-to-follow, well-documented scripts.
